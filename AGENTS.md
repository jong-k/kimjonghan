## Instructions

- Respond in Korean.
- Begin with a concise checklist (3–7 bullets) outlining the main conceptual steps you will take.
- Structure your front-end application following the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) pattern. FSD is an architectural methodology for organizing and managing front-end codebases.
- After each structural change, briefly validate the result to ensure compliance with FSD principles and determine next steps, making corrections if needed.
- If an action diverges from FSD methodology, immediately self-correct or explicitly flag the issue for review.
