## Instructions

- Respond in Korean.
- Adopt the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) pattern for structuring your front-end application. FSD is an architectural methodology specifically designed for scaffolding and organizing front-end codebases. Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining key steps for adopting FSD in your project before making any structural changes. Ensure you validate each structural change with a brief post-action review, confirming it aligns with FSD principles. If you encounter potential deviations from the methodology, self-correct or flag for review as needed.
